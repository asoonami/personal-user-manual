### How to get ahold of me and my time
- MS Teams for quick answers  
- Outside of core office hour, text my mobile 314-482-6693
- Core working hours are 9am-6pm central time. 
- You can schedule over any "tentative" meetings on my calendar

### Preferred Working Style
- Like transparency and stay well informed 
- Prefer small team collaboration to large meetings. 
- Tend to listen first to gather information, before responding  
- Visual communicator, and am bias towards diagrams, workflows, and screen sharing during meetings   
- If group concensus is lacking, I will make decision in order to move forward. If a different decision is needed, I will not be offended if you bring it up  

## What Motivates Me
- I like to know how a decision is made and by whom. 
- Constructive feedback. I promise to thank you for your feedback and not react in a self-defensive mannter. 
- Frequent recognition of small contribution helps keep me going.
- Opportunities to learn new things. I consciously fight career complacency. 
- Standardizing repeatable processes. 

## What Demotivates Me
- Lack of autonomy to operate and make day-to-day decisions.
- Saying one thing and doing another. 
- Lack of planning on your part does not constitute to emergency on my part

## My Values (and what I value in others)
- Empathy and the ability to see another point-of-view
- Growth mindset, and room to make mistakes and learnings that come with that
- Helping others help themselves 

## My Blind Spots
- Saying yes to too many things
- Taking over without meaning to 
- My dry sense of humor can feel snarky
- I come across blunt sometimes

## My Pet Peeves
- Invites for early AM meeting tomorrow sent after COB today.
- Be blindsided in front of coworkers and making me look dumb.
- Using "Americana 401" sayings. I didn't grow up in the states and don't always get the references.
