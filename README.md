### About Me

Transplant, living in St. Louis suburbs for 20+ years. I work at Environmental Science Research Institute (ESRI) - Professional Services team, managing engagements and projects. Organizing, planning, managing, those are my [Ordinary Superpowers](https://www.asuperpoweredlife.com/). My Spotify 2020 year-end review tells me I love listening to Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal, How I Built This with Guy Raz, Planet Money, and multitudes of National Public Radio (NPR) programming. Lately, I am exploring businesses that embraces [Stakeholder Capitalism](https://www.instituteforcorporatetransformation.com/podcast)   

## How to Contact Me
- MS Teams works for quick answers, and email for more detail responses  
- I like to have background and context, so please @mention me within the relevant channel, email chain, and especially Salesforce/Kimble Chatter
- Best way to reach me outside of core office hour is to text my mobile 314-482-6693
- General core working hours are 9-6pm central time. It is generally easier for me to work late than to start early. 

## Preferred Working Style
- I like transparency and stay well informed. Intentional obsfucation is a pet-peeve of mine. 
- Prefers pairing or small team collaboration rather than large meetings. 
- I tend to listen First to gather information, before responding. If I am quiet and staring into space, I am not distracted or ignoring you. I am merely thinking before responding. 
- When there isn't any group concensus, I will generally make a decision to move us forward. If you think a different decision is needed, I will not be offended if you bring it up either within the group or to me directly for discussion. 
- I am a visual communicator, and am bias towards diagrams, workflows, and screen sharing during meetings. 
- I am trying to be better at speaking up in larger group settings, and get over the fear of being judged.

## What Motivates Me
- While I don't have to be the decision-maker all the time, I like to know how a decision is made and by whom. 
- Constructive feedback. I promise to thank you for your feedback and not react in a self-defensive mannter. I will sometimes ask for details so I understand the context for which the feedback applies to.
- Frequent recognition of small contribution helps keep me going.
- Opportunities to learn new things. I consciously fight career complacency. 
- Standardizing repeatable processes. 

## What Demotivates Me
- Lack of autonomy to operate and make day-to-day decisions.
- Don't beat around the busy. I appreciate clear and straightforward communication, especially on tough topics.
- Saying one thing and doing another. 
- Lack of planning on your part does not constitute to emergency on my part. If in such situation, I respond well to request-for-collaboration.

## My Values (and what I value in others)
- Empathy and the ability to see another point-of-view
- Growth mindset, and room to make mistakes and learnings that come with that
- Enabling others to be successful

## My Blind Spots
- My dry sense of humor can feel snarky. You can say to me "that sounded snarky or disrespectful" and I will know I crossed the line. 
- I can come across as blunt when I am focused on finding a solution to a problem. You can say to me "I don't think that's your intent but it hurts my feeling". 
- Facilitating convos in a way that is win-win all around. 

## My Pet Peeves
- Invites for early AM meeting tomorrow sent after COB today.
- Be blindsided in front coworkers and making me look dumb
- Using what I called "Americana 401" sayings. I didn't grow up here so I don't always get the references.
