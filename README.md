### About Me
DISC: _SCI_   
Strengthfinder Themes: _Relator | Arranger | Input | Learner | Responsibility_

- Originally born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I've been living in St. Louis suburbs for 20+ years. 
- I'm on ESRI's - Professional Services - Midwest Regional Office, managing engagements & projects. Organizing, planning, managing, those are my [Ordinary Superpowers](https://www.asuperpoweredlife.com/).  
- Fav podcasts: Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal, How I Built This with Guy Raz, Planet Money, and multitudes of National Public Radio (NPR) programming.

### How to Contact Me
- MS Teams works for quick answers, and email for detailed responses  
- I like to have background and context, so please @mention me within the relevant channel, email chain, and especially Salesforce/Kimble Chatter
- Best way to reach me outside of core office hour is to text my mobile 314-482-6693
- General core working hours are 9-6pm central time. It is generally easier for me to work later than to start earlier, as early mornings are me time to workout and meditate.  

### Preferred Working Style
- Like transparency and stay well informed. 
- Prefer pairing or small team collaboration rather than large meetings. 
- Tend to listen first to gather information, before responding. If I am quiet and staring into space, I am not ignoring you. I am merely thinking before responding. 
- When there isn't any group concensus, I will generally make a decision to move us forward. If you think a different decision is needed, I will not be offended if you bring it up.
- Visual communicator, and am bias towards diagrams, workflows, and screen sharing during meetings. 
- I am trying to be better at speaking up in larger group settings, and get over the fear of being judged.

## What Motivates Me
- While I don't have to be the decision-maker all the time, I like to know how a decision is made and by whom. 
- Constructive feedback. I promise to thank you for your feedback and not react in a self-defensive mannter. I will sometimes ask for details so I understand the context for which the feedback applies to.
- Frequent recognition of small contribution helps keep me going.
- Opportunities to learn new things. I consciously fight career complacency. 
- Standardizing repeatable processes. 

## What Demotivates Me
- Lack of autonomy to operate and make day-to-day decisions.
- I appreciate clear and straightforward communication, especially on tough topics and feedback. No need to beat around the bush. 
- Saying one thing and doing another. 
- Lack of planning on your part does not constitute to emergency on my part, but if you need help, asking politely and I will be happy to collaborate.

## My Values (and what I value in others)
- Empathy and the ability to see another point-of-view
- Growth mindset, and room to make mistakes and learnings that come with that
- Helping others help themselves 

## My Blind Spots
- My dry sense of humor can feel snarky. You can say to me "that sounded snarky or disrespectful" and I will know I crossed the line. 
- I can come across as blunt when I am focused on finding a solution to a problem. You can say to me "I don't think that's your intent but it hurts my feeling". 

## My Pet Peeves
- Invites for early AM meeting tomorrow sent after COB today.
- Be blindsided in front of coworkers and making me look dumb.
- Using what I called "Americana 401" sayings. I didn't grow up here so I don't always get the references.
