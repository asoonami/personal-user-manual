### About Me

Transplant, living in St. Louis suburbs for 20+ years. I work at Environmental Science Research Institute (ESRI) - Professional Services team, managing engagements and projects. Organizing, planning, managing, those are my [Ordinary Superpowers](https://www.asuperpoweredlife.com/). My Spotify 2020 year-end review tells me I love listening to Marketplace with Kai Ryssdal, How I Built This with Guy Raz, Planet Money, and multitudes of National Public Radio (NPR) programming. Lately, I am exploring businesses that embraces [Stakeholder Capitalism](https://www.instituteforcorporatetransformation.com/podcast)   

## How to Contact Me
- MS Teams works for quick answers, and email for more detail responses  
- I like to have background and context, so please @mention me within the relevant channel, email chain, and especially Salesforce/Kimble Chatter
- Best way to reach me outside of core office hour is to text my mobile 314-482-6693
- General core working hours are 9-6pm central time. It is generally easier for me to work late than to start early. 

## Preferred Working Style
- I like transparency and stay well informed. Intentional obsfucation is a pet-peeve of mine. 
- Prefers pairing or small team collaboration rather than large meetings. 
- I tend to listen First to gather information, before responding. If I am quiet and staring into space, I am not distracted or ignoring you. I am merely thinking before responding. 
- When there isn't any group concensus, I will generally make a decision to move us forward. If you think a different decision is needed, I will not be offended if you bring it up either within the group or to me directly for discussion. 
- I am a visual communicator, and am bias towards diagrams, workflows, and screen sharing during meetings. 
- I am trying to be better at speaking up in larger group settings, and get over the fear of being judged.

## What Motivates Me
- While I don't have to be the decision-maker all the time, I like to know how a decision is made and by whom. 
- Constructive feedback. I promise to thank you for your feedback and not react in a self-defensive mannter. I will sometimes ask for details so I understand the context for which the feedback applies to.
- Frequent recognition of small contribution helps keep me going.
- Opportunities to learn new things. I consciously fight career complacency. 
- Standardizing repeatable processes. 

## What Demotivates Me
- Lack of autonomy to operate and make day-to-day decisions.
- Don't beat around the busy. I appreciate clear and straightforward communication, especially on tough topics.
- Saying one thing and doing another. 
- Lack of planning on your part does not constitute to emergency on my part. If in such situation, I respond well to request-for-collaboration.

## My Values (and what I value in others)
- Empathy and the ability to see another point-of-view
- Growth mindset, and room to make mistakes and learnings that come with that
- Enabling others to be successful

## My Blind Spots
- My dry sense of humor can feel snarky. You can say to me "that sounded snarky or disrespectful" and I will know I cross the line. 
- I can come across as blunt when I am focused on finding a solution to a problem. You can say to me "I don't think that's your intent but it hurts my feeling". 
- Facilitating convos in a way that is win-win all around.

    <summary>Tips</summary>
Recommended Section: Everyone needs help sometimes. This is a good section to list the things you know you need help with or actively want feedback on. One caveat is that listing something here doesn't automatically excuse it! If you know you need to work on a particular area then please make sure you are doing so, soliciting feedback to measure your progress.

## My Pet Peeves


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Optional Section: It might be tempting to use this section to vent, that's absolutely fine but the more constructive the better. If there are simple things people can reasonably avoid doing, then list them here. Bear in mind that you will also need to also read your squad members' pet peeves section, it's a 2 way street.

    <summary>Tips</summary>
Optional Section: There are some sections that are deliberately omitted from this template, but which arguably should be here - depending on your role, how comfortable you are sharing with your team etc. You may want to include these or use them as inspiration for your own.

- "How I like my 1:1s" - This might be more relevant for managers to set expectations of their direct reports. Although direct reports certainly should have a say in how their 1:1s are structured
- "Quirks" - While this is a fun one, there is a temptation to hide behaviour here that probably should be worked on instead. Additionally, behaviour is complex, situation dependent and evolving. Stating you have a particular quirk makes it immutable and sets the expectation that you will always act like this. That said please feel free to include a section like this as it's a good icebreaker, and adds a personal touch. Just be aware that you might be unaware of some of your own "quirky" behaviour.
- "How to interpret my calendar" - If you're someone with wall to wall meetings every day it might be difficult for colleagues to find a good time to speak with you. If this is the case, then this section might be helpful to outline when you typically could make time for them.
- "What you can expect from me" - Another one that might be useful for line managers, career coaches and mentors more than ICs. You may want to use this to set expectations around how often you'll be scheduling catchups, how you share feedback and what sort of support you can offer.
